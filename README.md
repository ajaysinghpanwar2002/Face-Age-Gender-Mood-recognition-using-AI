# Facial Recognition Advertising: The New Way to Target Ads at Consumers

# What is facial recognition?
Facial recognition is the use of biometric technology to detect and identify individuals based on their facial characteristics – i.e. eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, chin, ears. In order to do so, facial recognition systems integrate images, videos, or real-time footage.

# Facial Emotion Recognition
Facial emotion recognition is the process of analyzing facial expressions to identify or recognize emotions on a human face – disgust, joy, anger, surprise, fear, sadness, or other compound emotions – with image processing software

# Facial Emotion Detection Advertising with ALFI
Transformative AdTech company, ALFI, uses facial detection to create more targeted marketing by detecting facial emotion detection without storing any facial images – ultimately respecting user privacy. 

ALFI’s advertising platform can transition between ads depending on the person who is in front of the screen. For DOOH, that’s unheard of. ALFI can be installed on any device that has an internet connection and a camera, delivering personalized content and ads to any person looking at the screen.

While ALFI’s smart technology can detect emotion and behavior, it does not use cookies or store personal data, facial images, or information. It sets new standards by providing precise targeting information to advertisers, but it does so without intruding by collecting information in non-intrusive ways compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA.

# Facial Recognition in Advertising
Beyond essential businesses and security measures, facial recognition is now being used in retail stores and even advertising campaigns. The BBC used software from CrowdEmotion to measure the conscious and subconscious emotional responses to content marketing campaigns delivered via BBC.com. Its test of 5,000 people used webcams that recorded responses, dividing them into six potential emotions: sadness, puzzlement, happiness, fear, rejection, and surprise.  

# Facial Recognition Advertising Billboards
Meet the interactive billboard. Some billboard setups feature cameras built into the unit itself, while others have cameras set up in nearby areas or shopping centers. These large-scale ad spaces can be outfitted with powerful, dynamic technology capable of identifying gender, facial expression, age, and the makeup of passing crowds. 

After detection and analysis, the billboard has the ability to produce programmed responses, content, or videos that change depending on the gender, age, and mood of a pedestrian, for example.  

While the cameras can be used to gather valuable information for tailoring marketing campaigns, they can also be used for interactive advertising. 

Some agencies have even added interactive games for onlookers, using different campaigns that might include participating in a staring contest, performing a silly gesture, or dancing along with the content. The ad reacts according to the interactions and changes accordingly. Just think of how engaging this kind of ad can be when marketing to families with crowds and small children.
